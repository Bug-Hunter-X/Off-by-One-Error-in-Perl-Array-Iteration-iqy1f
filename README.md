This repository contains a Perl example demonstrating a common off-by-one error when iterating through an array. The `bug.pl` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides the corrected version. The error arises from the incorrect use of the `$#array` operator, which returns the index of the last element, not the total number of elements. This can easily lead to an array index out-of-bounds error.  The solution provides a correct method of iterating using a less error-prone approach.
